### <u>User Auth</u>

Users are required to sign up in order to post. An automated demo login button can be found on the login modal for quicker access to the UX.

### <u>Car CRUD</u>
Car owners can post their cars for rent, make edits, and delete their listings. Edit and delete options are displayed on the car show page if the current user is recognized as an owner. As an added security measure, any attempt to access another owner's car edit page forcefully redirects to the index.
